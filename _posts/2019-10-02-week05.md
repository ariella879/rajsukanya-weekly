### **_The article [Finding a project to contribute to][link] has a great amount of information and advice. It also has links to other webpages that help you in finding projects. Explore these links and comment on which might prove to be useful, and whether they have helped you to narrow down your search._** 

### **_Make some comments about all of this git and GitHub stuff you learned about this week. Hard? Easy? Confusing? Useful?_** 
  All of the things we learned about git and Github are extremely useful. Initially, it was confusing because it was my first time forking and cloning a repository and then pushing changes from my local machine to my fork and then to upstream. But with practice, I was able to get the hang of it and that is where the git activities were of extreme help. Through the git activities, I am able to practice what I learned. While learning it, it made sense and I thought I can do it with ease. However when I had to do it by myself, it did not come to me that easily. I often missed steps or was not sure what the next step was. I really appreciated that the professor created [Contribution Workflow][collab]. I referred back to it often when I got lost and was not sure of the order of the steps I needed to take. Hence, learning and putting those things into practice through the git activities were very helpful.

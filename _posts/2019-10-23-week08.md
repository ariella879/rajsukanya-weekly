title: Week 8

### **_Project:_**    
I finally found a project to make my first contribution to. The project I chose was [codezilla](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla). This is the project I did my project evaluation on last week. Throughout this week, I was looking for a project in which I can make a documentation contribution instead of writing code. Initially, I couldnâ€™t find any project that needed documentation changes and so, I moved on to find projects in C++ because it is the only programming language I am familiar with. Then I remembered that codezilla contains algorithms implemented in several programming languages. I thought I can search for an algorithm that does not have a C++ implementation of it yet. As I was searching through the algorithms, I found that the readme files have some spelling and grammatical mistakes. I decided to make this my first contribution.

### **_Week 8 Summary:_**  
I did not do much this week, other than searching for open source projects. It took me a while to come to my final decision because like I said earlier, I wasn't able to find a project where I can make a documentation contribution. But I am really glad that I can contribute to the project that I did my project evaluation on. I wish I thought of it sooner.

### **_Comment on your experience with the Git activity that you did in class. Was it useful? Was it confusing? Did you have time to finish? Did you have merge conflicts? Were you able to resolve them?_**  
  I found this git activity very useful because it was my first time working on something with a group of people at the same time. I have only pushed and committed changes on school projects by myself before and because I was working by myself, I did not experience any kind of trouble. However through this activity, I learned about merge conflicts and how to resolve them. By the time I was going to push my changes to the remote repository, my teammates had already made changes and so, I used the command _git pull_ to update the local version of the repository from the remote repository and then, I was able to push my changes. I am very glad we did this activity because I learned something new and was able to experience what it is like when multiple people are working on a project simultaneously.

### **_What have you learned so far with respect to these statements in [10 things you should know about open source before you use it][link]?_**  
* It's not always free
* Open source is not just for programmers
* You don't have to be an expert to use it
* Freeware and shareware are not the same as open source

* You're probably already using it

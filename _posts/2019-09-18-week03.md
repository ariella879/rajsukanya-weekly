### **_What have you learned so far with respect to these statements in [10 things you should know about open source before you use it][link]?_**  
* #### **It's not always free**  
I was under the misconception that open source software meant that it is always free of charge. I have also never used or heard about open source software that has charges, which led me to believe that open source software is free. 
* #### **Open source is not just for programmers**
* #### **You don't have to be an expert to use it**
* #### **Freeware and shareware are not the same as open source**  
I was not familiar with the terms “freeware” and “shareware” before attending this class. And before I also did not know that the source code had to be available in order for software to be open source. 
* #### **You're probably already using it**  
Before taking this class, I did not know much about open source and it never occurred to me to search if I am using any until now. It turns out I have! When I took introduction to computer science, we were first introduced to Notepad++ and we used that platform to code. I am also using Adblock Plus for a while now and I had no idea that it was an open source browser extension until now.

### **_Thoughts on [Election fraud: Is there an open source solution?](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/voting-fraud-open-source-solution?)_**  
In class, we previously discussed about this after Karen Sandler had visited our class. She talked about her defibrillator and realizing the importance of making open source software. We then discuss in class how not only medical devices could be affected by this, but also elections because most voting systems are proprietary.

This reading talks about the incident in Mississippi, which is a serious problem that 
"Due to market dynamics and industry performance issues, there has been no commercial incentive to make the investment in the necessary research and development to produce the kind of high-assurance, mission-critical systems for verifiable and accurate elections," says Gregory Miller, co-founder and COO of the OSET Institute."
Through this class, an important lesson I learned is that proprietary software is not beneficial to anyone and can instead be harmful. Hence, it is crucial to make software open source as much as possible.

### **_Project Progress_**    
On Nov 14: I created an [issue](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/issues/445) to fix grammar mistakes in [insert.md](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/blob/master/unordered_map/insert.md) for unordered_map. On the same day, the maintainer [assigned me this issue](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/issues/assigned/rajsukanya).  
On Nov 17: I created a [pull request](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/pull/446) after fixing the grammar mistakes.  
The maintainer has not merged my pull request as of now, however I am glad this project is more active than my previous one. Now, I am looking for another issue to work on. I would like to find something more involving this time. I don't mind fixing documentation mistakes, but I would like to try to implement something. Since this project is in C++, I think it's time I try to make a coding contribution.  

### **_Summary of Week 13:_**      
I made three more contributions to Wikipedia. Last week, I randomly searched through some Wikipedia pages and found a few spelling and grammar errors I could fix. But it was more time-consuming to find pages in this way because some didn't have any mistakes and I would continue to search for another page. However this week, I decided to look up TV shows that I previously watched and/or am currently watching. Surprisingly, I found grammatical and spelling mistakes on the first page I looked at. Then it became easier for me to make more contributions.

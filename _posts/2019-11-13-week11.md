### **_Guest Speaker: Kevin Fleming_**  
### **_Project Progress_**    
Last week, I created a new issue on codezilla to work on adding documentation for the sorting algorithm, radix sort. But they still haven't merged my [previous pull request](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla/pull/465), which was made 14 days ago. Seeing that this project is not actively maintained, my professor adviced me to look for a more active project. So I [closed the issue](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla/issues/466) I created for radix sort. I recently decided to work on a project I reviewed on week 6, [30-seconds-of-cpp](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp). This project is in C++ and it seems to be more active than codezilla. As I quickly browsed through the repository, I found a small grammar mistake on the readme file for the [insert method](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/blob/master/unordered_map/insert.md) for unordered_map. I want to thoroughly look through the repository to find a bigger contribution I can make. Hopefully by next week, I will be able to find something I can work on.

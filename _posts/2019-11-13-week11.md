### **_Guest Speaker: Kevin Fleming_**  
Our third guest speaker was Kevin Fleming from Bloomberg. He talked about Bloomberg's involvement with open source. I enjoyed his presentation because now I have a firm idea about what Bloomberg does. One of the things that amazed me was when he talked about how their system went down one day. It made me realize the large scale of their importance and how their work impacts others globally. 
Both Bill Reyner and Kevin Fleming talked about how their business interacts with open source. Bloomberg contributes to open source because it helps them in the long run. Kevin Fleming mentioned that he has been at Bloomberg for about seven years, so they have been involved in open source for much longer than FactSet. When Bill Reyner came, he mentioned that contributing to open source projects is also encouraged at FactSet. Overall, I think it is very important that companies like Bloomberg and FactSet are contributing to open source and crucial that other companies also realize the importance of doing so.  

### **_Project Progress_**    
Last week, I created a new issue on codezilla to work on adding documentation for the sorting algorithm, radix sort. But they still haven't merged my [previous pull request](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla/pull/465), which was made 14 days ago. Seeing that this project is not actively maintained, my professor adviced me to look for a more active project. So I [closed the issue](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla/issues/466) I created for radix sort. I recently decided to work on a project I reviewed on week 6, [30-seconds-of-cpp](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp). This project is in C++ and it seems to be more active than codezilla. As I quickly browsed through the repository, I found a simple grammar mistake on the readme file for the [insert method](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/blob/master/unordered_map/insert.md) for unordered_map. I want to thoroughly look through the repository to find a bigger contribution I can make. Hopefully by next week, I will be able to find something I can work on.   
### **_Week 11 Summary:_**  
I made two contributions to Wikipedia (I fixed some spelling and grammatical mistakes) and I read:  
* [System76 introduces laptops with open source BIOS coreboot](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/coreboot-system76-laptops?utm_campaign=intrel)  
I think it is interesting that they will be releasing laptops powered with open source firmware coreboot soon. Not only because most firmware is proprietary nowadays, but because it makes your computer boot faster and more sure. Making anything open source is beneficial and they point out the benefit of doing so: "_Coreboot's source code can be inspected, learned from, and modified, just like any other open source code._" This is the key importance of having open source.  
* [Open Firmware](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/10/239673-open-source-firmware/fulltext)
This article highlights the importance of having open source firmware. "Open source firmware can help bring computing to a more secure place by making the actions of firmware more visible and less likely to do harm." They also discuss why proprietary firmware is harmful: "Making matters worse, most firmware is proprietary. The code that runs with the most privilege has the least visibility. This leads to breaches and incidents that have the capacity to affect users on multiple platforms simultaneously. To hackers this is like catnip." So how can we check if the firmware has any vulnerabilities? They explain that it is not possible to know so without a firm root of trust and that vendors have their "own way of implementing a root of trust". "The goal of this article is to make readers feel empowered to demand more from vendors who can help drive this change." They also encourage readers to spread the word and to use platforms that value open source firmware components.

### **_Talk by Karen Sandler_**
Karen Sandler is the executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) and she visited our class on October 3rd to talk about software licenses and software freedom. I was most intriguied by her personal experience, which led her to become a strong advocate for open source software. Being diagnosed with a heart condition in her twenties turned her life around in a way that opened her eyes to see the importance of open source software, especially when she was being shocked unnecessarily by her defibrillator when she was pregnant due to heart palpitations. Sandler's personal experience made me realize the seriousness behind making software open source. Her doctors did not know what her defilibrator ran on and because defibrillators are usually given older people, she was an edge case. But nonetheless, software should be robust because it can cost people their lives and not only in the case of medical devices, but also vehicles, elections, etc.  Generally, when we make any kind of decision about our lives, we try to make the best one possible to make sure the decision we made benefits us.
